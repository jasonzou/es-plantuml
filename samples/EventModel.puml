Issue(concern, "A Concern")
System(system, "A System")
Event(event, "An Event")
Aggregate(aggregate, "An aggregate card", "Aggregates are also groups...")

}

note bottom of allCardTypes
The card types bounded context is displayed last instead of first.

The card types are displayed in order but not kept on one line.

Also this note is supposed to be at the bottom of the bounded context.

BoundedContext(orders, "Orders"){
  Group(orderCommands) {
    Command(placeOrder, "Place Order", "") 
    Command(cancelOrder, "Cancel Order", "")
    Command(validateOrder, "Validate Order", "")
  }
  Group(orderAggregate) {
    Aggregate(erica, "Orders", "")
  }
  Group(orderEvents) {
    Event(orderPlaced, "Order Placed", "") 
    Event(orderCancelled, "Order Cancelled", "")
    Event(orderValidated, "Order Validated", "")
  }  
  Rel_L(orderAggregate, orderCommands)
  Rel_R(orderAggregate, orderEvents)
}
note bottom of orders
The groups are displayed in reverse order for some reason and 
my layout macros aren't helping.

Also groups are spaced too far apart.

note bottom of sampleContext
With a lot of effort I can get commands, aggregates,
and events more or less where I want them.

The spacing is still odd though.
